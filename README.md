# A2R

> A highly opinionated transformer for .adoc files to turn them into self-contained Reveal.js presentations

## Why?

Because the asciidoc plugin is opinionated, and the opinions behind it clash with mine.

## What to expect?

A2R is a CLI tool that takes a .adoc file as input and generates a single HTML file with a Reveal.js presentation inside.

You can find a lot more information in [the presentation deck](./test/deck.adoc), but of course it's meant to be turned into a Reveal.js presentation :wink:.

I'll generate GitHub pages for it once I publish the repository and CLI tool.
