# Changelog

## 1.0.1

* :triangular_ruler: Include the bundled deck base in the source code

   > This moves Parcel in the dev dependencies, where it belongs and hopefully fixes usage of a2r in GitHub Actions where it failed because of a Parcel-related error (`Could not resolve module "@parcel/config-default"`).   

## 1.0.0

Initial release
